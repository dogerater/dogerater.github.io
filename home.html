                <h1>What is the ELO System?</h1>
                <p>
                    The ELO system was created by and named after Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physicist. Originally, it was intended to accurately assess the playing strength of members of the United States Chess Federation (USCF). Many players simply didnâ€™t believe that disparate tournament results could provide a representative view of their playing strength and wanted a more precise system that could better reflect their true ability relative to other players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the demands of their constituents, the USCF hired Elo to craft a statistically sound rating system to replace prior attempts (which often led to the establishment of ratings considered erroneous)  at creating a universal methodology that would inspire confidence in players with its fairness and simplicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With those goals in mind, Elo formulated a procedure that took into account the difference in ratings between the two competitors to determine a probabilistic prediction for the outcome of a match. The winner of the match would then gain points dependent on the difference in ratings (with victory against a much lower rated foe leading to a minor increase in rating whereas beating a vastly higher rated opponent would result in a significant gain of rating points) and the loser would lose points similarly directly dependent on the difference in ratings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elo made quite a few simplifying assumptions in his model, but the simplicity with which his formula could be applied invariably led players to feel it was fair and accurate. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, the ELO system has been expanded to assess performance and relative strength in a variety of competitive pursuits including the NBA, MLB,  NFL, MLS, as well as in e-sports. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our game, the dogs being compared have been assigned a baseline ELO rating based on an algorithmic analysis. Your selection of which dog is cuter in a head-to-head matchup leads to a correction in their ELO ratings according to the following formula.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Result of the game (1 for a "win" against another dog and 0 for a "loss") - Expected Probability] * k-Factor (which is a value dependent on rating, win percentage, and number of competitive "matches"). Where Expected Probability is given by 1/(1+10 <sup>(opponentRating - yourRating)/400</sup>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: If dog A has ELO = 1600 and is chosen as cuter than dog B with ELO = 1200, then 

                    Dog A's expected probability was 

                    1/(1+10 <sup>(1200-1600)/400</sup>) = 1/(1+10 <sup>-400/400</sup>) = 1/(1+10 <sup>-1</sup>) = 1/1.1= .91 

                    If we assume dog A has a k-factor of 30, then we have a rating change of (1 - .91) * 30 = 2.7 which rounds up to 3 points.

                    Therefore, dog A has a new rating of 1603.
