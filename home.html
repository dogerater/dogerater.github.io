                <h1>What is the ELO System?</h1>
                <p>
                    The ELO system was created by and named after Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physicist. Originally, it was intended to accurately assess the playing strength of members of the United States Chess Federation (USCF). Many players simply didn’t believe that disparate tournament results could provide a representative view of their playing strength and wanted a more precise system that could better reflect their true ability relative to other players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the demands of their constituents, the USCF hired Elo to craft a statistically sound rating system to replace prior attempts (which often led to the establishment of ratings considered erroneous)  at creating a universal methodology that would inspire confidence in players with its fairness and simplicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With those goals in mind, Elo formulated a procedure that took into account the difference in ratings between the two competitors to determine a probabilistic prediction for the outcome of a match. The winner of the match would then gain points dependent on the difference in ratings (with victory against a much lower rated foe leading to a minor increase in rating whereas beating a vastly higher rated opponent would result in a significant gain of rating points) and the loser would lose points similarly directly dependent on the difference in ratings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elo made quite a few simplifying assumptions in his model, but the simplicity with which his formula could be applied invariably led players to feel it was fair and accurate. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, the ELO system has been expanded to assess performance and relative strength in a variety of competitive pursuits including the NBA, MLB,  NFL, MLS, as well as in e-sports. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our game, the dogs being compared have been assigned a baseline ELO rating based on an algorithmic analysis. Your selection of which dog is cuter in a head-to-head matchup leads to a correction in their ELO ratings according to the following formula.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Result of the game (1 for a “win” against another dog and 0 for a “loss”) - Expected Probability]
    * k-Factor (which is a value dependent on rating, win percentage, and number of competitive “matches”). Where Expected Probability is given by 1/(1+10^((opponentRating- yourRating)/400)).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: If dog A has ELO = 1600 and is chosen as cuter than dog B with ELO = 1200,
    then 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dog A’s expected probability was 
                </p>
                <p>
                    1/(1+10^((1200-1600)/400)) = 1/(1+10^(-400/400)) = 1/(1+10^-1) = 1/1.1= .91 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we assume dog A has a k-factor of 30, then we have a rating change of (1 - .91) * 30 = 2.7 which rounds up to 3 points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, dog A has a new rating of 1603.
                </p>
